# resto

Resto is a purpose-built note taking app for restaurant visits. When you go to a restaurant you write down your experiences with what you ordered. You review the dish and rate it so that when you visit the same restaurant again in the future you remember what you ordered previously.

Resto is built with SwiftData and SwiftUI and requires XCode 15 to run.
